Peer review by Yue Huang

1. Be clear in your goals and emphasize that the project is focused on using modern web technologies such as AJAX, React, and MongoDB.
2. The project structure is well-organized with a clear separation of frontend and backend. In the backend, routers define specific routes, controllers handle business logic, and database operations for different collections are distributed across separate files.
3. The color palette is professional and the design is user-friendly.
